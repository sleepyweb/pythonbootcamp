## Course Outline:
### Defining and Calling Python Functions:
Functions are block of codes, it works when called in. We create a new function by using `def`, anything indented under it will be performed.

### Indentation
It's the space before the line of code. This incdicates a set or block of codes. Python executes the indented blocks of code when the function is called later in the program.


```
# this how we create a new function
def bootcamp():

    # the space before the print statement is indentation
    print("Hello, Python World!")


bootcamp()
```
Output:
```
Hello, Python World!
```

### While Loops
`while` loops work as when some condition is true then it perfoms the loop. 
```
i = 1
# while checks for the condition and run until it goes to FALSE
while i < 5
  print(i)
  i += 1
```
Output:
```
1
2
3
4
```
All of today's challenges was based on Hurdle game on [Reeborg's World](https://reeborg.ca/reeborg.html?lang=en&mode=python&menu=worlds%2Fmenus%2Freeborg_intro_en.json&name=Hurdle%201&url=worlds%2Ftutorial_en%2Fhurdle1.json). It gave a good idea on how function works and we can use loops and if/elif/else to do small tasks using different function.

## Project: Escapting the Maze
**Description:** This is a game on Reboorg's World. [Escaping the Maze](https://reeborg.ca/reeborg.html?lang=en&mode=python&menu=worlds%2Fmenus%2Freeborg_intro_en.json&name=Maze&url=worlds%2Ftutorial_en%2Fmaze1.json) 

**My Solution:** [escaping_the_maze.py](https://github.com/sleepyweb/pythonbootcamp/blob/main/day_6/escaping_the_maze.py)

*note:* the above code has some bugs, has to debugged after completing a few more day's lesson.
