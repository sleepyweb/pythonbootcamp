I'm starting a new journey in Python. [100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) by Dr. Angela Yu is one of the highest-rated courses on Python for beginners. The course is mixed with some tutorials and projects for each day.

## Course Outline:
It begins with how to use the `print` function.
```
print("hello dev")
```

It moves forward to the `input` function and how to create variables and store values.
```
name = input("Enter your name: ")
```

## Project: Band Name Generator

**Description:** It takes two inputs from the user about the city they grew up and their pet's name. Creates a new name adjoining both of the inputs. <br>
**My Solution:** [band_name_generator.py](https://github.com/sleepyweb/pythonbootcamp/blob/main/day_1/band_name_generator.py)
